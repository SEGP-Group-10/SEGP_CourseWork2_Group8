Software Title: "Pro-life"
Supervisor: Dr. Adil Raja & Mr. Muhammad Saqib 
Brief description: Human beings are the only species on Earth capable of coordinating on a large scale, which can be rightly credited as its biggest strength. Protocols and tools exist to enhance this ability, a significant example being the Internet. 
As our software engineering group project, an application enabling communication between two end user will be created. No existing frameworks will be used in the implementation of the project. 
In the course of the project, emphasis has been placed on learning of new concepts, specifically networking programming and working our way around Android studio with a know how of Kotlin language. The basic scope of the project includes communication via text messages between two connected users. Additional functionality includes but is not limited to, voice and image processing in the form of sending/receiving files and calls. 
Version control and coordination amongst the group members is being facilitated by GitHub, Google HangOut and WhatsApp with completed milestones committed on Git. Work on a professional software engineering project proposal is underway and shall be available on GitHub shortly. The learning framework being followed is Scrum - an Agile methodology that emphasizes team organization, functioning software, effective management with continuous feedback and flexibility. The Scrum Master is Muzammil Abdullah, with rotation due every fortnight after poll among group members.
